# Chatbot Markup Language
XML-based language for orchestrating chatbots for use with GreenWatt VoiceBot.

## Initialization
- \<chatbot initialText="" id="" voicemail=""> <\chatbot>
	 - The root for conversation flows originated by an outbound call
	 - Defines the voicemail to be sent if the contact does not pick up
---
- \<chatbot_inbound>
    - The root for conversation flows originated by an inbound call
    - Will retain data from any previous outbound conversation coming from the same bot.
 ---
- \<chatbot_data>
	<\chatbot_data>
	- Defines data before the chatbot begins.
	- Only \<const> and \<var> statements are allowed.

## Control Flow
- \<if condition=""> <\if>
	- Branch based on result of evaluating the given boolean condition. Can use boolean operators ! (NOT), && (AND), || (OR)
	- Be very careful with this. Non-conditional prompts will fail.

## Conversation Activities
- \<static_message text="">
	- Sends a string message to the contact.
---
- \<ai_message prompt="">
	- Sends a message generated by the AI engine using the given prompt.
---
- \<extract data_prompt="" var=''> <\extract>
	- Extracts data from the context of the conversation using the given data prompt (plaintext description of the data to get).
	- If the extraction was successful, operations within the body are executed and can access the data through the named variable.
	- Provide as much guidance within the data prompt as possible.
---
- \<infer conditional="" var=''>
	- Evaluate the given plaintext conditional prompt.
	- Place the boolean result in the named variable.

## GHL
- \<appt_booking booked="">
	- Books the contact's desired appointment, if possible
	- Variable declared in "booked" is a boolean which notifies if the appointment has been booked
---
- \<add_tags tags="tag1;tag2;...">
	- Adds the required tags to contact's GHL record
---
- \<remove_tags tags="tag1;tag2;...">
	- Removes the required tags from contact's GHL record
---
- \<set_field field="" variable=''>
	- Sets GHL custom field to variable value

## Variables
- \<str_var name='' value="">
	- Declares or updates a named variable.
	- Will not evaluate expressions.
- \<bool_var name='' value="">
	- Declares or updates a boolean variable.
	- Will evaluate boolean expressions.
- \<int_var name='' value="">
	- Declares or updates a integer variable.
	- Will evaluate integer expressions.
- All values can be referenced in non-identifier strings like so: "~{name}"
	- Identifier strings are shown in this document by single quotes: ''
	- All other strings will use double quotes: ""
